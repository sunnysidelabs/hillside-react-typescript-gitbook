# When to use Pagination, Infinite Scroll, and Windowing?

As each comes with its own set of limitations, this begs the question on when one is preferred over the other.

****[**Infinite Scroll**](https://paul-cham.gitbook.io/hillside/react/large-dataset-by-using-infinite-scroll) is well suited for sequentially loaded content such as social media.

****[**Windowing**](https://paul-cham.gitbook.io/hillside/react/large-dataset-by-windowing-using-react-window-recommended) is well suited when you want to display the entirety of data without any impact on performance.

****[**Pagination**](https://paul-cham.gitbook.io/hillside/react/large-dataset-by-using-pagination) is when you want to display chunks of data while giving full control to the end user such as admin panel or content management systems.

**There are no silver bullets. All methods come with its own set of advantages and limitations.**
